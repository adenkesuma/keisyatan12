As an OCs, we gave our last love message speech to our participants. We cried a lot because this experience is really meaningful for us. I just wish we not forget each other.</p>

I learned how to brainstorm about the 1 month agenda with my partner, do the stakeholder’s market research, and also how to synergize with other departments that related to our project. Beside the professional benefit, I also become able to improve my social skills with my team, Eightxtramiles. I tend to be a closed person, but over the past 5 months, I have become more of a person who opens up to other people in positive ways."</p></i>

The challenging environment here didn't stress me out too much because my team could provide mental support for each other, especially when meeting 59 participants who are enthusiastic about contributing and always giving encouragement to the OCs. Thank you so much to the local project for choosing me to grow in Hearth 1.0, and best of luck to everyone."</p></i>
