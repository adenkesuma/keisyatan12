                    <p>We went to the Mangrove Kampoeng Nipah beach for our Execution Day 2. There so much fun because we can see the mudskipper everywhere! We should be careful while walking there. We planted the mangrove tree and took so many photos. I would like to go there again with the same people.</p>

                    <p>This session made us feel blue, because our project is already over. Our participants cried when we played a throwback video compilation. As an OCs, we gave our last love message speech to our participants. We cried a lot because this experience is really meaningful for us. I just wish we not forget each other.</p>

                    <p>This will be my hardest part as OCs, because we are no longer present as a team. We will have a different things to do, and maybe get to lost contact. We decided to take a picture for the last meet. I hope they have a great journey, whatever it is.</p>
